# Railway Database Setup Complete ✅

## What We Did

1. **Added PostgreSQL Service** ✅
   - Successfully added PostgreSQL to your Railway project
   - Service name: postgres
   
2. **Added Redis Service** ✅
   - Successfully added Redis to your Railway project
   - Service name: redis

3. **Linked Services to Main Application** ✅
   - Both services are now part of your InventorySync project
   - They will be accessible via internal Railway network when deployed

4. **Retrieved Connection Strings** ✅
   - PostgreSQL URL: `postgresql://postgres:nVytOSmJkCuVHifJsZoMFwsuEgJZVrvE@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway`
   - Redis URL: `redis://default:WLVdmieztrGHBKFukRtIsFUrESmWUdSJ@redis.railway.internal:6379`

5. **Updated Environment Variables** ✅
   - Updated `/home/brend/inventorysync-shopify-app/backend/.env` with Railway database URLs
   - Added both sync and async PostgreSQL connection strings

## Important Notes

### Production Deployment
- The `.railway.internal` URLs work **only** when your app is deployed on Railway
- Railway automatically injects these environment variables into your deployed application
- No additional configuration needed for production

### Local Development Testing
To test the databases locally, you have two options:

**Option 1: Railway Port Forwarding**
Run `./railway_db_forward.sh` for instructions on how to forward ports locally.

**Option 2: Use Local Databases**
Keep using your local PostgreSQL and Redis for development, and Railway databases for production.

## Testing Database Connectivity

1. **Local Testing with Port Forwarding:**
   ```bash
   # In one terminal:
   railway run --service postgres -- railway port-forward 5432
   
   # In another terminal:
   railway run --service redis -- railway port-forward 6379
   
   # Then run the test:
   ./test_db_connection.py
   ```

2. **Production Testing:**
   Once deployed to Railway, the connections will work automatically with the internal URLs.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy your application to Railway to use the production databases
2. Set up any required database migrations
3. Configure your application to use different database URLs for development vs production
