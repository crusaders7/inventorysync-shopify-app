## üåê Custom Domain Setup

### 1. Add Custom Domain in Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project: https://railway.com/project/de832abe-3d73-40ef-9fc5-c4054e8af06c
2. Click on your service (Inventorysync)
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
4. Click "Add Custom Domain"
5. Enter: `inventorysync.prestigecorp.au`
6. Railway will provide DNS records

### 2. Configure DNS Records
Add these records to your domain's DNS (prestigecorp.au):

```
Type: CNAME
Name: inventorysync
Value: inventorysync-production.up.railway.app
TTL: 300
```

Or if Railway provides an A record:
```
Type: A
Name: inventorysync
Value: [Railway's IP]
TTL: 300
```

### 3. Update Shopify App URLs
Once DNS propagates (5-30 minutes), update in Shopify Partners Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://partners.shopify.com/4377870/apps/[your-app-id]/edit
2. Update these URLs:
   - App URL: `https://inventorysync.prestigecorp.au`
   - Redirect URLs:
     ```
     https://inventorysync.prestigecorp.au/api/v1/auth/callback
     https://inventorysync.prestigecorp.au/auth/callback
     ```
