## üìã Step-by-Step Actions (30 minutes total)

### 1. Update Partners Dashboard URLs (5 minutes)
Go to your [app settings](https://partners.shopify.com/4377870/apps/265561079809/edit) and update:

**App URL**: 
```
https://inventorysync-shopify-app-production.up.railway.app
```

**Allowed redirection URL(s)**: Add these URLs
```
https://inventorysync-shopify-app-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/callback
https://inventorysync-shopify-app-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/callback
https://inventorysync-shopify-app-production.up.railway.app/auth/callback
```

### 2. Get Your API Credentials (2 minutes)
From your Partners Dashboard, copy:
- API key (Client ID): `b9e83419bf510cff0b85cf446b4a7750`
- API secret key: [Get from dashboard]

### 3. Configure Railway Environment Variables (10 minutes)

Go to your [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app) and add these variables:

```bash
# Shopify Credentials (from Partners Dashboard)
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=b9e83419bf510cff0b85cf446b4a7750
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_from_partners_dashboard
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=generate_or_get_from_dashboard

# App URLs
APP_URL=https://inventorysync-shopify-app-production.up.railway.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://inventorysync-shopify-app-production.up.railway.app

# Security Keys (generate these)
SECRET_KEY=use_command_below_to_generate
JWT_SECRET_KEY=use_command_below_to_generate
ENCRYPTION_KEY=use_command_below_to_generate

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Features
ENABLE_MULTI_LOCATION=true
ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIELDS=true
ENABLE_FORECASTING=true
ENABLE_WORKFLOWS=true
```

**To generate secure keys**, run these commands:
```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32

# Generate JWT_SECRET_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32

# Generate ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 4. Deploy Updated Configuration (5 minutes)

```bash
# Commit the updated shopify.app.toml
cd /home/brend/inventorysync-shopify-app
git add shopify.app.toml
git commit -m "Update shopify.app.toml with Railway URLs"

# Deploy to Railway
railway up
```

### 5. Test Installation Flow (5 minutes)

1. Create a development store in Partners Dashboard (if not already done)
2. Test the install URL:
   ```
   https://inventorysync-shopify-app-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/install?shop=your-dev-store.myshopify.com
   ```
3. Verify OAuth flow completes successfully
4. Check that webhooks are registered

### 6. Quick Fix for Middleware Error (3 minutes)

I noticed an error in the deployment. Let's fix it:

```python
# File: backend/middleware/security_headers.py
# Update the class to accept initialization parameters

class SecurityHeadersMiddleware:
    """Add security headers to all responses"""
    
    def __init__(self, app):
        self.app = app
    
    async def __call__(self, request: Request, call_next):
        response = await call_next(request)
        # ... rest of the code remains the same
```
