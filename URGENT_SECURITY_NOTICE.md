# ðŸš¨ URGENT SECURITY NOTICE

## Exposed Credentials Found

The following credentials were found in your `.env` file and need to be rotated IMMEDIATELY:

### 1. Shopify API Credentials

- **API Secret**: `d10acb73054b2550818d3e8e5775105d`
- **Action Required**: 
  1. Go to https://partners.shopify.com
  2. Navigate to your app
  3. Regenerate API credentials immediately

### 2. Railway Database Credentials
- **PostgreSQL Password**: `nVytOSmJkCuVHifJsZoMFwsuEgJZVrvE`
- **Action Required**: 
  1. Go to Railway dashboard
  2. Rotate PostgreSQL password
  3. Update all connections

### 3. Railway Redis Credentials
- **Redis Password**: `WLVdmieztrGHBKFukRtIsFUrESmWUdSJ`
- **Action Required**: 
  1. Go to Railway dashboard
  2. Rotate Redis password
  3. Update all connections

### 4. Sentry DSN
- **DSN**: `https://9d4bb65fdc3051703db90ab619ae5438@o4509479242694656.ingest.de.sentry.io/4509654764879952`
- **Action Required**: 
  1. Go to Sentry dashboard
  2. Generate new DSN
  3. Update configuration

## Steps to Secure Your Application

1. **Rotate All Credentials Immediately**
   - Follow the actions above for each exposed credential

2. **Update Railway Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables set SHOPIFY_API_KEY="new_key_here"
   railway variables set SHOPIFY_API_SECRET="new_secret_here"
   railway variables set SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET="generate_random_secret"
   ```

3. **Never Store Secrets in .env Files**
   - Use Railway's environment variables instead
   - Keep .env files for local development only
   - Always use placeholder values in committed files

4. **Generate a Webhook Secret**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

## Secure Environment Variable Management

For Railway deployment, set variables directly:
```bash
# Set all variables in Railway dashboard or CLI
railway variables set KEY="value"
```

For local development:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your local development credentials
3. NEVER commit `.env` files with real credentials

## Additional Security Measures

1. Enable 2FA on all accounts (Shopify Partners, Railway, Sentry)
2. Use strong, unique passwords
3. Regularly rotate credentials
4. Monitor for unauthorized access
